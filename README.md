# Real-Time Music Generation Project

Welcome to the Real-Time Music Generation project repository! This project is part of my university coursework (PSC for **Polytechnique**) and focuses on creating a system that generates music in real-time using innovative algorithms and techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the realm of real-time music generation, combining computer science and music theory to produce unique and dynamic musical compositions. The project leverages various technologies and libraries to achieve this, providing a platform for experimentation and creativity.

## Features

- Real-time music generation based on user input and system parameters.
- Support for different musical genres and styles.
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for musical pattern recognition.
- Seamless integration with MIDI devices and external controllers.
- Export functionality for generated compositions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **MIDO**: A Python library for working with MIDI files, facilitating the creation and manipulation of musical data.
- **Threading and rtmidi**: Explore the use of libraries for real-time audio processing.
